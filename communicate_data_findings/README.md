## Dataset

> The workbook of agricultural data contains 3 worksheets; Box Placement, Wet harvest and Dry Harvest. The workbooks are a result of the enumerators filling in box placement, wet harvest and dry harvest forms during the crop cuts experiment process. 

> The crop cuts experiment process is a process whereby enumerators are hired, trained and visit farmers to go and measure their yields. We equip the enumerators with a digital survey data collection application.  These enumerators conduct 3 farm visits.  The first visit is called box placement. It is during this visit that they get to fill the box placement survey. The key information captured by box placement measurement form is the farmers identification details, the size and the number of the boxes placed, the number of crops in the farm, the health of the crops, the GPS location of the farm and the picture of the farm.

> The main activity conducted during the second visit is to measure the fresh weight of the harvest. We have labelled this activity wet harvesting. The wet harvest measurement form is used to record the weight of the crops immediately harvested from the boxes randomly placed on the farm.  

> Later on after the crops are dried, our enumerators conduct a third visit to go and measure the dry weights of the crops harvested. The dry weights are recorded using a dry harvest measurement form. The enumerators normally place 2 boxes on the farm. The standard dimensions of these boxes are 8 meters by 5 meters. It is from these boxes that the enumerators harvest and not the whole field. A protocol is normally provided to guide the enumerators on how to place the boxes in an objective way. Sometimes due to obstacles on the field the enumerator is forced to place one box or revise the standard dimension. The dimensions of the box are normally captured under the box placement form. 


## Summary of Findings

> Wheat crop planted by broadcast method has higher yields on average compared to wheat planted in rows.
> Average wheat yields are higher around distances 0-5km from water body compared to more than 5km distances.
> The wheat yields are highest around 500M ASL. The crop does well in altitudes of between 0M and 900M ASL.
> Bauchi has the highest total yields while Abia has the lowest total yields.
> On the average yields, Kaduna has the highest yields, while Zamfara has the lowest.
> Listed farmers have slightly higher average yields compared to control farmers.
> Farmers who are listed and use broadcasted planting are have higher yields than control farmers who use broadcast planting.
Farmers who are listed and use rows have less yields compared to control farmers who use row planting.
> Irrigations in areas 0-5km to water body lead to reduced yields, while irrigations around areas more than 5km from water bodies lead to increased yield.
> When crops are planted solo, broadcasting method procuces higher yields than rows method, with a small margin. When crops are intercropped, briadcast method significantly increases the yield, with a higher margin compared to rows method
> The plantations are far from the ocean. They are aligned along rivers, with few of them close to lakes
